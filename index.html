        <h3>CMSC 22</h3>
        <p>This subject really challenged me last semester. There were times that I thought I couldn't do it but I pushed through. The project was also very fulfilling once finished. I get to tell my family and friends that I made a game by myself.</p>

        <h3>ETHICS</h3>
        <p>This GE subject is by far the most memorable I had. I enjoyed learning different theories and philosophies. A lot of my friends hated this back then but I was silently having fun as it really piqued my interest.</p>

        <h3>PYTHON</h3>
        <p>I realized that it was the easiest one to understand even if I had a hard time in CMSC 12. Now that I know and tried vairous programming languages, I missed Python. Oh, to be a freshie again.</p>

        <h3>PORK</h3>
        <p>I love almost any dish that involves pork, especially if it is fried. I think Tustadong Adobo is my top 1. I also love sweets, specifically cookies and cream ice cream and recently been obsessed with macaroons.</p>

      <dt>Favorite CMSC subject:</dt> <br>
      <dd>CMSC 22 because it really challenged me last semester. There were times that I thought I couldn't do it but I pushed through. The project was also very fulfilling once finished. I get to tell my family and friends that I made a game by myself.</dd> <br>
      <dt>Favorite GE subject:</dt> <br>
      <dd>ETHICS 1 because I enjoyed learning different theories and philosophies. A lot of my friends hated this back then but I was silently having fun as it really piqued my interest.</dd> <br>
      <dt>Favorite programming language:</dt> <br>
      <dd>PYTHON because I realized that it was the easiest one to understand even if I had a hard time in CMSC 12. Now that I know and tried vairous programming languages, I missed Python. Oh to be a freshie again.</dd><br>
      <dt>Favorite food:</dt> <br>
      <dd>PORK - almost any dish that involves pork, especially if it is fried. I also love ice cream and recently been obsessed with macaroons.</dd>

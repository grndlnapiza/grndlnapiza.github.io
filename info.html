        <h3>CMSC 22</h3>
        <p>This subject really challenged me last semester. There were times that I thought I couldn't do it but I pushed through. The project was also very fulfilling once finished. I get to tell my family and friends that I made a game by myself.</p>

      <div class="col">
        <h3>ETHICS</h3>
        <p>This GE subject is by far the most memorable I had. I enjoyed learning different theories and philosophies. A lot of my friends hated this back then but I was silently having fun as it really piqued my interest.</p>

        <h3>PYTHON</h3>
        <p>I realized that it was the easiest one to understand even if I had a hard time in CMSC 12. Now that I know and tried vairous programming languages, I missed Python. Oh, to be a freshie again.</p>

      <div class="col">
        <h3>PORK</h3>
        <p>I love almost any dish that involves pork, especially if it is fried. I think Tustadong Adobo is my top 1. I also love sweets, specifically cookies and cream ice cream and recently been obsessed with macaroons.</p>

      <div class="col">
        <h3>HOBBIES</h3>
        <p>Listening to Taylor Swift is like breathing for me, I won't last a day without hearing her voice. My hobbies also include reading books but I haven't read much lately. I love to watch series (finished Grey's Anatomy!), k-drama, and just recently, youtube vlogs. </p>

        <h3>TO BE A PRINCESS</h3>
        <p>There were a lot to choose from but this is the one that I really remember. I dreamt of riding a carriage, having a castle as my home, all the fancy gowns and elegant parties, but most especially, having my own prince charming.</p>
